# Rock/Paper/Scissors/Lizard/Spock
This is my first game (and first project on my own), created using Python + Pygame.
It's still a little messy - a lot of initializing happens in not-ideal spaces - and I'm sure I've made the logic more complex than it needs to be...
Any advice is greatly appreciated!
